# Basic Spatial Data Drawing (to SVG) with Node.js

This example shows how to load a geojson file containing Berlins "Bezirke" and draw it to a SVG. It also creates a bounding box of each "Bezirk" using the turf library.

## Usage  

- Open a terminal in the root of this folder or `cd` into it.
- Install all dependencies `npm install`
- Run the script `npm start`

The script will be run and wait for changes until it is run again.
It will export a SVG file to the `out/` folder and open it in the browser for viewing it.
