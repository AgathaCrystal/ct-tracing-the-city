# Drawing Data with Node.js to SVG

This example shows how to:

- read in a file
- parse the CSV in it
- create a abstract table object from it
- identify minimum and maximum value
- create a SVG from it using node-canvas

It mostly resembles the examples [basic data drawing with vanillajs](../basic-data-drawing-with-vanillajs/README.md) and [basic data–drawing with p5js](../basic-data–drawing-with-p5js/README.md) except that it already creates the desired SVG.

## Usage

- `cd` into the root if this folder
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` (will run `index.js` with `nodemon` and open a browser window with the SVG displayed using `reload`)
- changes to the content of index.js should also reload the browser window
